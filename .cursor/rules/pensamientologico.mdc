Rule Type: Auto
Let sequentialThinking decide which MCP tools to use for solving multi-step tasks.

@sequentialThinking
Use this rule when the task involves:
- Information retrieval
- Web navigation or interaction
- UI component suggestions
- Visualization or documentation search

This rule delegates the orchestration logic to sequentialThinking. It will analyze the user's goal and dynamically determine whether to use:
- @brave for web search
- @puppeteer for web automation
- @context7 for resolving or documenting libraries
- @magicuidesign/mcp for UI components or visual elements

Let the toolchain be determined based on reasoning flow. Do not include unnecessary tools unless justified.

Example:
"Build a UI mockup based on current UX trends" → triggers:
1. brave → search UX trends
2. puppeteer → extract key ideas
3. context7 → lookup component libraries
4. mcp → render UI elements
